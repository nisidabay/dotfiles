git pull --rebase --autostash
-----------------------------

    What it does: This command updates your local branch with changes from a
    remote branch. It does this by rebasing your local changes on top of the
    incoming changes, which creates a linear history. The --autostash option
    automatically stashes any uncommitted changes you have before the rebase and
    then reapplies them afterwards.

    When to use it: Use this command when you want to update your local branch
    with changes from the remote branch, and you have local modifications that
    you don't want to commit just yet. It's particularly useful for maintaining
    a clean and linear commit history without the need for manual stashing and
    unstashing of local changes.
