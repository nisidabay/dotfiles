Find first ocurrence of a character in a string
-----------------------------------------------
# Define the string
str="Kotlin in 8 Hours"

# Define the character to search for
character="n"

# Use the 'expr index' command to find the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string
index=$(expr index "$str" "$character")

# Print the result
echo "The index of the first occurrence of '$character' in the string is: $index"

Another way more Bashish
------------------------
# Define the string
str="Kotlin in 8 Hours"

# Define the character to search for
character="n"

# Find the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string
index=$(( ${str%%$character*} + 1 ))

# Print the result
echo "The index of the first occurrence of '$character' in the string is: $index"
