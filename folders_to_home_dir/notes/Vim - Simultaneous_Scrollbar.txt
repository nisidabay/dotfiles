If you have more than one split in Vim, and you want to scroll
them together (for example two vertical splits), here's what you
need to do:

- In each window that should scroll simultaneously, enter the
command: :set scrollbind

You can enter scb as an abbreviation for scrollbind.

You might now that ! flag causes :set to toggle a boolean
configuration option.
Therefore, you can easily toggle scrollbind on or off by running:

:set scb!
