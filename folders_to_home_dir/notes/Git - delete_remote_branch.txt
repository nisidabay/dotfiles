git push origin --delete feat-branch
------------------------------------

What it does: 
This command deletes the branch named feat-branch from the remote repository
named origin. It's a remote operation that removes the specified branch from the
server/repository that is being tracked remotely.

When to use it: 
Use this command when you need to clean up or remove branches from the remote
repository that are no longer needed. 

Common scenarios include: 
After merging a feature branch into the main development branch and the separate
feature branch is no longer required.

        If a branch was created by mistake or has become obsolete.
        To enforce branch naming conventions or clean up after renaming branches.
        As part of a repository maintenance routine, where old or stale branches
        are removed to keep the repository tidy and manageable.

It's important to note that this command only deletes the branch in the remote
repository. If you have a local copy of the feat-branch, it will remain on your
local machine. To delete the branch locally, you would use git branch -d
feat-branch (or git branch -D feat-branch if the branch hasn't been fully
merged).

Remember, this command affects the remote repository, so it should be used
cautiously, especially in collaborative environments, to avoid accidentally
deleting branches that are still in use by others.
