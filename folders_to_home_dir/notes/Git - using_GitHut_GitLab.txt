Using GitHub & GitLab at the same Time
--------------------------------------

To upload your code to both GitHub and GitLab simultaneously, you can configure
multiple remotes in your Git repository. Here's how you can achieve this:

Navigate to your local repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and
navigate to the directory of the Git repository that you want to configure for
dual uploading.

Add remotes: Use the following commands to add the remotes for GitHub and GitLab:

  git remote add github <GitHub repository URL>
  git remote add gitlab <GitLab repository URL>
